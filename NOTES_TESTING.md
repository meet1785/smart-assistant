## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Create Note from LeetCode Problem
1. Open a LeetCode problem
2. Click "AI Learning Assistant" button
3. Go to Features tab
4. Click "Smart Notes"
5. Create a note about the problem
6. Verify note has "leetcode" platform badge
7. Verify source URL is the LeetCode problem URL

### Scenario 2: AI Enhancement
1. Create a simple note: "Binary search finds elements quickly"
2. Click "Enhance with AI"
3. Wait for enhancement
4. Verify enhanced note has more details and better structure
5. Verify "AI Enhanced" badge appears
6. Edit the note to see original content is preserved

### Scenario 3: Search and Filter
1. Create 5 notes with different tags:
   - "Binary Search" with tags: algorithm, search
   - "React Hooks" with tags: react, frontend
   - "Binary Tree" with tags: algorithm, trees
   - "CSS Grid" with tags: css, frontend
   - "Graph Algorithms" with tags: algorithm, graphs
2. Search for "binary" - should show 2 results
3. Filter by "algorithm" tag - should show 3 results
4. Search for "binary" AND filter by "algorithm" - should show 2 results
5. Clear filters - should show all 5 notes

### Scenario 4: Export and Persistence
1. Create multiple notes
2. Export all notes
3. Verify JSON file downloads
4. Close the extension
5. Reopen the extension
6. Verify all notes are still there

## Performance Testing

### Note Creation Performance
- Creating 100 notes should complete in < 5 seconds
- UI should remain responsive during bulk operations

### Search Performance
- Searching through 1000 notes should return results in < 100ms
- Filter updates should be instant

### AI Enhancement Performance
- AI enhancement should complete in 2-5 seconds
- UI should show loading state during enhancement
- Multiple enhancement requests should queue properly

## Security Testing

### Data Storage
- [x] Notes are stored in Chrome's local storage
- [x] No sensitive data is sent to external servers except Gemini API
- [x] API calls use secure HTTPS connections
- [x] Notes are only accessible by the extension

### Input Validation
- [x] Title and content fields have length limits
- [x] Tag input sanitizes special characters
- [x] HTML/script injection is prevented
- [x] URL validation for source links

## Accessibility Testing

- [ ] Keyboard navigation works throughout the modal
- [ ] Focus management is proper when opening/closing modal
- [ ] Screen reader announces modal state changes
- [ ] All interactive elements have proper ARIA labels
- [ ] Color contrast meets WCAG AA standards

## Browser Compatibility

Tested on:
- [ ] Chrome 120+
- [ ] Edge 120+
- [ ] Brave Browser
- [ ] Opera

## Known Limitations

1. No offline AI enhancement (requires API connection)
2. No collaborative features (single-user only)
3. No note versioning (only original + enhanced version)
4. No rich text formatting (plain text only)
5. Export only supports JSON format

## Future Enhancements

1. Rich text editor with markdown support
2. Note attachments (images, code snippets)
3. Note sharing and collaboration
4. Cloud sync across devices
5. Note templates for different learning scenarios
6. Automatic note organization by topic
7. Spaced repetition reminders for notes
8. Integration with flashcard system
