# Flashcard System - Feature Documentation

## Overview

The Flashcard System is an intelligent spaced repetition learning tool integrated into the Leeco AI Learning Assistant. It leverages the SM-2 (SuperMemo 2) algorithm to optimize long-term retention of information across LeetCode problems, YouTube educational content, and general web learning.

## Why This Feature?

### Problem Statement
While the extension already had a backend API for generating flashcards (`generateFlashcards` in `background.ts`), there was **no user interface** to actually use this functionality. This represented a significant gap - the infrastructure existed but was completely inaccessible to users.

### Solution Benefits
1. **Scientifically Proven**: Uses the SM-2 algorithm, proven to improve long-term retention by 2-3x
2. **Seamless Integration**: Works naturally with existing Smart Notes feature
3. **AI-Powered**: Automatically generates flashcards from study notes using Gemini AI
4. **Multi-Platform**: Creates flashcards from any learning content (LeetCode, YouTube, articles)
5. **Progress Tracking**: Integrates with existing XP and achievement systems

## Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. Flashcard Store (`src/stores/flashcardStore.ts`)
**Purpose**: Zustand-based state management for flashcard data and review sessions

**Key Features**:
- Persistent storage using Zustand middleware
- SM-2 algorithm implementation
- Review session management
- Statistics and analytics

**Data Structure**:
```typescript
interface Flashcard {
  id: string;
  front: string;                    // Question/term
  back: string;                     // Answer/definition
  type: 'concept' | 'definition' | 'code' | 'problem' | 'fact';
  difficulty: 'easy' | 'medium' | 'hard';
  tags: string[];
  sourceNoteId?: string;            // Link to original note
  sourcePlatform?: 'leetcode' | 'youtube' | 'general';
  sourceUrl?: string;
  
  // SM-2 Algorithm Fields
  createdAt: number;
  lastReviewed?: number;
  nextReviewDate: number;           // When the card is due
  reviewCount: number;              // Number of times reviewed
  correctCount: number;             // Number of correct reviews
  intervalDays: number;             // Days until next review
  easeFactor: number;               // SM-2 ease factor (default 2.5)
}
```

**SM-2 Algorithm Implementation**:
- Quality ratings from 0-5:
  - 0: "Again" - Complete blackout
  - 1: "Hard" - Incorrect but recognized
  - 2: "Good" - Correct with hesitation
  - 3: "Easy" - Correct without hesitation
  - 4: "Perfect" - Instant recall
  - 5: "Too Easy" - Card is too simple

- Intervals calculated based on:
  - First review: 1 day
  - Second review: 6 days
  - Subsequent: Previous interval Ã— ease factor

#### 2. Flashcard Manager Component (`src/components/FlashcardManager.tsx`)
**Purpose**: Main UI for creating, managing, and reviewing flashcards

**Views**:
1. **List View**: Browse all flashcards with filtering by tags
2. **Create View**: Manual flashcard creation
3. **Review View**: Interactive spaced repetition review session

**UI Features**:
- Real-time statistics dashboard
- Tag-based filtering
- Progress bar during review sessions
- Color-coded quality rating buttons
- Due card highlighting
- Responsive modal design

#### 3. Integration Points

**EnhancedTutorInterface** (`src/components/EnhancedTutorInterface.tsx`):
- Added flashcard button in Tools tab
- Opens FlashcardManager modal

**NotesManager** (`src/components/NotesManager.tsx`):
- Added "ðŸŽ´ Flashcards" button on each note

## Technical Implementation Details

### SM-2 Algorithm Implementation

```typescript
function calculateNextReview(
  quality: number,      // 0-5 rating
  reviewCount: number,  // Times reviewed
  intervalDays: number, // Current interval
  easeFactor: number    // Current ease factor
): { intervalDays, easeFactor, nextReviewDate }
```

**Algorithm Logic**:
1. Update ease factor based on quality:
   ```
   newEF = max(1.3, EF + (0.1 - (5 - q) * (0.08 + (5 - q) * 0.02)))
   ```

2. Calculate interval:
   - If quality < 3: Reset to 1 day (failed)
   - First review (count = 0): 1 day
   - Second review (count = 1): 6 days
   - Subsequent: interval Ã— easeFactor

3. Schedule next review:
   ```
   nextReviewDate = now + (intervalDays * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000)
   ```

### Data Persistence

**Storage Location**: Chrome's local storage via Zustand persist middleware

**Storage Key**: `leeco-ai-flashcards`

**Data Structure**:
```json
{
  "flashcards": [
    {
      "id": "card_1234567890_abc123def",
      "front": "What is time complexity of binary search?",
      "back": "O(log n) - halves search space each iteration",
      "type": "concept",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "tags": ["algorithms", "complexity"],
      "sourceNoteId": "note_1234567890_xyz789",
      "sourcePlatform": "leetcode",
      "createdAt": 1698765432000,
      "lastReviewed": 1698851832000,
      "nextReviewDate": 1699456632000,
      "reviewCount": 3,
      "correctCount": 3,
      "intervalDays": 7,
      "easeFactor": 2.6
    }
  ]
}
```

### Performance Considerations

**Bundle Size**:
- FlashcardManager: ~21KB (minified)
- flashcardStore: ~8KB (minified)
- Total addition: ~29KB to content scripts

**Optimization Strategies**:
1. Lazy loading: Component loaded only when opened
2. Efficient rendering: React keys for list items
3. Memoization: Stats calculated only when needed
4. Batched updates: Zustand handles state efficiently

**Memory Usage**:
- ~1KB per flashcard
- 1000 flashcards = ~1MB
- Reasonable for typical usage (50-200 cards)

- **Solution**: Check browser settings, clear old data

**Problem**: AI generation fails
- **Cause**: API key issues or rate limits
- **Solution**: Verify API key, check quota

**Problem**: Review session doesn't start
- **Cause**: No due cards or cards filtered out
- **Solution**: Clear tag filters, check due dates

### Debug Information

**Check Storage**:
```javascript
chrome.storage.local.get(['leeco-ai-flashcards'], (result) => {
  console.log('Flashcards:', result['leeco-ai-flashcards']);
});
```

**Verify Store State**:
```javascript
// In console when extension open
useFlashcardStore.getState()
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Data Privacy**: All flashcards stored locally, never sent to external servers
2. **API Security**: Gemini API key encrypted in Chrome storage
3. **XSS Prevention**: React auto-escapes user input
4. **Input Validation**: Front/back content sanitized
5. **Rate Limiting**: Respects Gemini API rate limits
