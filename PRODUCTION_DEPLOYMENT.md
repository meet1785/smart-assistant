- `storage`: Store user preferences and API key securely
- `https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/*`: Make API calls to Google Gemini
- `host_permissions`: Inject content scripts on LeetCode, YouTube, and educational websites

### Data Privacy
- No user data is collected or transmitted to external servers
- All AI interactions go directly to Google Gemini API
- Learning progress is stored locally in Chrome storage
- No analytics or tracking implemented

## üìä Performance Optimization
