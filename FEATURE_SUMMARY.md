## Feature Highlights

### 1. AI-Powered Enhancement
```typescript
// One-click AI enhancement
const handleEnhanceNote = async (note: Note) => {
  const response = await chrome.runtime.sendMessage({
    action: 'enhanceNote',
    data: { content: note.content, title: note.title, platform: note.platform }
  });
  enhanceNoteWithAI(note.id, response.content);
};
```

### 2. Advanced Search
```typescript
// Real-time search and filter
getFilteredNotes: () => {
  let filtered = [...state.notes];
  if (state.searchQuery) {
    filtered = filtered.filter(note => 
      note.title.toLowerCase().includes(query) ||
      note.content.toLowerCase().includes(query)
    );
  }
  if (state.selectedTags.length > 0) {
    filtered = filtered.filter(note =>
      state.selectedTags.every(tag => note.tags.includes(tag))
    );
  }
  return filtered;
}
```

### 3. Session Integration
```typescript
// Automatic session linking
addNote({
  title: formData.title,
  content: formData.content,
  platform: currentPlatform,
  sessionId: currentSession?.id,  // Links to learning session
  sourceUrl: window.location.href
});
```
